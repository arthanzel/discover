	<div class="quote">&quot;Over half of Canada's electricity generation comes from hydroelectric sources.&quot;</div>
	<p>Energy extracted from hydroelectric sources stems back to Ancient Egypt, when farmers would use primitive water wheels to grind wheat and corn. More modern applications have extended the technology's reach to generating electricity, powering millions of homes.</p>
	<p>Large-scale dams can power entire cities, but small-scale installations also exist that provide energy to smaller towns (especially in Europe), or single houses. Apart from energy, dams also played a very important role, historically, in regulating water flow and allowing previously infertile areas to be irrigated, making the land suitable for farming. Today, in Slovakia, the <i>Cunovo</i> and <i>Gabcikovo</i> dams are instrumental in regulating the level of the Danube river, a major artery for trade in central europe.</i>
	<p>Energy from water can be extracted from humble, home-made water wheels to advanced turbine systems present in developed countries. As long as water flows, it is an inexhaustible source of energy, especially suitable for developing regions in the tropics. A single, well-built dam can power a remote town forever.</p>
