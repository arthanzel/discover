	<p>Nearly all life on Earth is dependent on the light from the sun to survive. The energy output of the sun that falls even on a surface as small as the Earth is essentially limitless.</p>
	<p>Electricity from the sun can be generated by converting sunlight directly into electricity using photovoltaics (a sophisticated array of semiconductors that channel electrons through a circuit when energized by light), or by capturing solar energy as heat, boiling water to power a turbine.</p>
	<p>In the picture is a solar power plant near Seville, Spain, which uses hundreds of mirrors to direct light onto a &quot;power tower&quot;, creating steam, which turns a turbine.</p>
	<p>While solar arrays are prohibitively expensive for adoption into national power grids, many individuals are turning to solar panels on their roofs to heat their homes and pools, power their appliances, and reduce the strain on the current power supply, which is largely based on combustible fossil fuels.</p>
