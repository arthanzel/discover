	<div class="quote">&quot;More than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. come from fossil fuels.&quot;</div>
	<p>Nearly three quarters of all of the world's electricity is generated from gas, coal, and petroleum. Certainly, the historical convenience of refining fossil fuels has caused countless power plants and refineries to be built, as well as the construction millions of kilometers of oil pipeline worldwide.</p>
	<p>The potential environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels are severe - rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can raise the planet's temperature, destroying many natural ecosystems and setting off a chain reaction that can propagate across the globe. Melting ice at the poles will raise the sea level, sinking major populations centres like New York and the entire area of Holland.</p>
	<p>By 2080, the Earth's fossil fuel reserves are projected to be depleted, and our primary supply of energy, in one of history's greatest dramas, will be extinguished.</p>
