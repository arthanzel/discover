	<div class="quote">&quot;The Earth's wind resource is so large that it could provide five times the total energy consumed by the entire planet.&quot;</div>
	<p>As the energy from the sun warms certain parts of the planet, currents of air are generated that flow across the planet and create weather and climate. These currents form both still lakes and grand rapids of wind, which can be harnessed using wind turbines to generate an unlimited supply of mechanical and electrical energy.</p>
	<p>Small-scale turbines can be deployed almost anywhere, and can be made from scrap metal and bicycle frames to sophisticated carbon fibres and steel. In third-world countries where water is scarce, wind power can bring a stream of energy to light homes or extract water from wells, without devoting resources to building infrastructures and maintenance.</p>
