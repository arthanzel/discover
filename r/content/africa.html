	<p>There are places on Earth where people struggle every day to obtain what is considered a human right by many countries - food, clean water, and medicine. In undeveloped countries around the world, people must live on just pennies a day, using a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.</p>
	<p>These regions are poverty-stricken because they have little access to energy. A device as simple as a water wheel can provide the energy required to automate many aspects of daily life. Crops could be sown, water could be pumped out of underground aquifers, and electricity could be generated to power buildings and machinery.</p>
	<p>What undeveloped regions lack is an infrastructure for creating and distributing energy. First-world nations sport sophisticated water lines, national power grids, and an efficient transport system that keeps people connected and makes necessities readily accessible. With new, sustainable, modular technologies such as high-efficiency solar panels and geothermal generators, this infrastructure could be brought to regions where it is truly needed.</p>
