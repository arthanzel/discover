	<p>In 2002, Canadians generated 30.5 million tonnes of waste, most of which finished its journey in dumps and landfills. Waste represents energy that developed countries discard for the sake of convenience; energy that is difficult to reclaim in a usable form.</p>
	<p>Plasma gasification is a process by which solid waste is efficiently converted into a gas, which is cleanly burned to generate power. Residual waste is converted into a thick, tar-like substance used in construction. By capturing a population's output of energy in the form of garbage, plasma gasification can reclaim nearly 95% of that energy and divert it from landfills, with minimal greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
	<p>For every tonne of waste, plasma gasification can reclaim 1 MWh of electricity, 150kg of construction aggregates, and 300L of clean water.</p>
	<p>Reduce, reuse, recycle, recover.</p>
