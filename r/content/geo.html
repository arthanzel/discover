	<p>Volcanos are manifestations of the immense quantity of energy available underneath the Earth's crust. A few kilometers below the surface begins a vast, inhospitable sea of magma that warms the bottom layer of the crust. This heat is such that the energy stored in just the layer that is accessible to us is 280,000 times larger than the global consumption of energy every year.</p>
	<p>Geothermal energy is already being used in the U.S, and in northern countries such as Iceland, where geothermal vents conveniently present a source of geothermal energy. However, geothermal energy can be harnessed anywhere on Earth, and many people are installing geothermal pumps in their own homes for heating and cooling.</p>
	<p>Geothermal energy is perhaps the most abundant, powerful, and least understood source of energy. It is capable of providing nearly free energy for practically forever, and few geographical or environmental barriers exist that prevent its capture at any point on Earth, as is the case with hydroelectric or solar power. An energy grid based on geothermal power would be free of greenhouse gas emissions, non-renewable fuel sources, and to some extent, cost, making it an ideal energy source for any nation.</p>
